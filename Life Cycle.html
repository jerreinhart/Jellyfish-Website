            The life cycle of a jellyfish is comprised of six stages.

        <h3>1-2 The Egg & The Planula</h3>
         <img src="jellyfishPlanula.jpg" alt="A photo of a jellyfish planula" width = 200pxl />
        <p>
            After mating, a fertilized egg turns into a planula which is able to move with the ocean currents. After a few days, the planula attaches itself to a firm surface.
        </p>
        <h3>3-4 The Polyp</h3>
        <img src="jellyfishPolyp.jpg" alt="A photo of a jellyfish polyp" width = 200pxl />
        <p>
            The attached planula then turns into a polyp. This polyp has a mouth and tentacles which it uses to feed itelf. After some more time, the polyp goes through a process of asexual reproduction, called 'budding'. Each 'bud' breaks off of the polyp and forms its own jellyfish.
        </p>
        <h3>5-6 The Mobile Jellyfish</h3>
        <img src="jellyfishMedusa.jpg" alt="A photo of a fully grown jellyfish" width = 200pxl />
        <p>
            These newly separated buds are called Ephyra Larva, and they are essentially immature jellyfish. After some time in this stage, the Ephyra mature into Medusas, which generally live only a few months.
