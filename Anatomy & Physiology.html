            Jellyfish have very simple anatomy compared to many other animals. They are <i>invertebrates</i>, meaning they do not have a backbone. In fact, jellyfish do not have any bones! They also do not have brains. There are many species of jellyfish that have a variety of different characteristics; however they all have some things in common.
        </p>
        <p>
            All species of jellyfish have a <b>bell</b>. This is the dome or disc shaped flabby part at the top of the jellyfish. Dangling from the bell are the jellyfish's <b>tentacles</b>, covered in venomous <i>nematocysts</i>, that sting anything that touches them. In addition to their stinging tentacles, jellyfish also have <b>oral arms</b>, which are specialized tentacles used to draw food into the animal's mouth. Jellyfish only have one opening in their bodies, so the food goes in through the <b>mouth</b>, it is digested inside the <b>gastric cavity</b>, and the waste is expelled back out of the mouth.
